We're going to spend two days working on R code so let's take a moment to open up RStudio to orientate ourselves. @cr-blank

Here is a snapshot of the RStudio environment.  @cr-myimage

There's a lot going on! 

Let's break it down.

This is an R script file (`.R` extension). Here you can write R code to clean, analyse, and visualise data [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="30%, 20%" scale-by="1.5"}

Notice that this file is saved with a proper file name `analysis.R` so we can open and close the file and come back to the code as needed. [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="60%, 80%" scale-by="2"}

This area has several tabs. The **Environment** tab plays a key role in managing and visualizing the objects that exist in the current R session. [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="-30%, 40%" scale-by="1.5"}

Various types of objects can exist in your environment, for example vectors, dataframes and lists.

Currently we can see the `cars` dataset and the `meanSpeed` value stored in the environment.

Notice the **Git** tab is also in this area. We'll use that later.


There are several important tabs in the bottom right-hand corner [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="-30%, -40%" scale-by="1.5"}

The **Files** tab shows us all the file in our project. Spot `analsis.R`!

From here we can open files or navigate to different folders. 

Other important tabs in this area includes the **Plots** tab, where are plots will appear, and the **Packages** tab that has a list of all the installed packages.

Here we have the console. [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="30%, -40%" scale-by="1.5"}

The console allows you to run R commands interactively. You can type a command directly into the console and press Enter to execute it and view the results straight away. 

The console keeps track of previously executed commands. You can use the ↑ up and ↓ down arrow keys to scroll through past commands, making it easy to re-run commands or modify and execute them again.

Working in the console is convenient for quick, interactive commands, but it doesn't save a persistent record of your entered commands so important code should always be saved in a script.

Finally, note this icon in the top right-hand corner. This tells us we are working in an R Project named `cars-study`. [@cr-myimage]{pan-to="-80%, 80%" scale-by="1.5"}
